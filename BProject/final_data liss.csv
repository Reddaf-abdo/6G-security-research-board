communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless;;;;;
communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and;;;;;
efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and;;;;;

signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades,;;;;;
great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly;;;;;

"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07116v1,Efficient Integration of Distributed Learning Services in Next-Generation Wireless Networks,2025,""Distributed learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence";;;;;
enabler, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for;;;;;
local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy;;;;;
and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design;;;;;
with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current;;;;;
designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs;;;;;
that assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource;;;;;
allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of;;;;;
the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the;;;;;
system, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times.;;;;;
This work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the;;;;;
importance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB;;;;;
traffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the;;;;;
consumed time and energy by DL within the CR. Due to its intractability, a;;;;;
session-based optimization problem has been proposed assuming a large-scale;;;;;
coherence time. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such problems;;;;;
and simulation results confirm the importance of such efficient and accurate;;;;;
"integration design."",,";;;;;
