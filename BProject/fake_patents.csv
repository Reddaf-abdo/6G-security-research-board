",2023,The present disclosure relates to a 5G communication system or a 6G communication system for supporting higher data rates beyond a 4G communication system such as long term evolution (LTE). The present disclosure provides a system and method for security protocol implemented in a communication network. The method performed by a first network entity includes determining based on a HUB being in a trusted area or in a non-trusted area, whether one or more network functions (NFs) are configured to perform security operations based on a generation of a message by a corresponding one or more NFs. Determining, based on a result of the determination that one or more NFs are not configured to perform the security operation, one or more network entities that are configured to perform the security operation, wherein the one or more network entities comprises at least one of the HUB, a Central Unit User Plane (CU-UP), and a Distributed Unit (DU), wherein a plurality of security keys are generated by the determined one or more network entities, and wherein the generated plurality of security keys is shared with a user equipment (UE)."",,";;;;;

,2023,The invention discloses a B5G/6G network slice authentication method oriented to the industrial Internet, which mainly solves the problems of complex network slice authentication flow and certificate management and high cost in the prior art. The implementation scheme is as follows: the third party key generation center generates a signature private key based on the user equipment identity by adopting a certificate-free mode; the user equipment selects a proper slice according to own service requirements; the user equipment initiates a connection request for the selected slice, and signs a request message based on an SM2 digital signature algorithm; selecting a slice to verify the request of the user equipment, negotiating a session key with the user equipment, encrypting a response message which is successfully verified by the session key, and sending the response message to the user equipment; the user equipment decrypts the response message to complete authentication. The invention does not need a certificate, improves the signature speed, simplifies the authentication flow of the slice and the user equipment, reduces the communication and calculation cost, and can be used for the B5G/6G network in the industrial Internet.;
