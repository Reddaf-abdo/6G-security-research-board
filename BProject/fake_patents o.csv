http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08091v1;Revolution of Wireless Signal Recognition for 6G: Recent Advances, Challenges and Future Directions;2025;"Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is a crucial technique for intelligent
communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless
communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and
efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and
reliability. Additionally, WSR can be applied for military applications such as
signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades,
great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly
focus on model-based methods, including likelihood-based (LB) and feature-based
(FB) methods, which have taken the leading position for many years. With the
emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent methods including
machine learning-based (ML-based) and deep learning-based (DL-based) methods
have been developed to extract the features of the received signals and perform
the classification. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of WSR from
the view of applications, main tasks, recent advances, datasets and evaluation
metrics, challenges, and future directions. Specifically, intelligent WSR
methods are introduced from the perspective of model, data, learning and
implementation. Moreover, we analyze the challenges for WSR from the view of
complex, dynamic, and open 6G wireless environments and discuss the future
directions for WSR. This survey is expected to provide a comprehensive overview

http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07116v1;Efficient Integration of Distributed Learning Services in Next-Generation Wireless Networks;2025;"Distributed learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence
enabler, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for
local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy
and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design
with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current
designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs
that assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource
allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of
the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the
system, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times.
This work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the
importance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB
traffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the
consumed time and energy by DL within the CR. Due to its intractability, a
session-based optimization problem has been proposed assuming a large-scale
coherence time. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such problems
and simulation results confirm the importance of such efficient and accurate
integration design.";;

networks, designed to enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization
of network performance. When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques,
particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs
emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network
operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of
DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address
critical challenges in 6G networks. We highlight key technical challenges that
need to be addressed, such as ensuring network reliability, achieving joint
data-scenario forecasting, and maintaining security in high-risk environments.
Additionally, we propose several pipelines that integrate DNT and ML within
coherent frameworks to enhance network optimization and security. Case studies
demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed pipelines in edge
caching and vehicular networks. In edge caching, the pipeline achieves over 80%
cache hit rates while balancing base station loads. In autonomous vehicular
system, it ensure a 100% no-collision rate, showcasing its reliability in
safety-critical scenarios. By exploring these synergies, we offer insights into

http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21286v1;Enabling AutoML for Zero-Touch Network Security: Use-Case Driven Analysis;2025;"Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a state-of-the-art paradigm shift
towards fully automated and intelligent network management, enabling the
automation and intelligence required to manage the complexity, scale, and
dynamic nature of next-generation (6G) networks. ZTNs leverage Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance operational efficiency,
support intelligent decision-making, and ensure effective resource allocation.
However, the implementation of ZTNs is subject to security challenges that need
to be resolved to achieve their full potential. In particular, two critical
challenges arise: the need for human expertise in developing AI/ML-based
security mechanisms, and the threat of adversarial attacks targeting AI/ML
models. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of current
security issues in ZTNs, emphasizing the need for advanced AI/ML-based security
mechanisms that require minimal human intervention and protect AI/ML models
themselves. Furthermore, we explore the potential of Automated ML (AutoML)
technologies in developing robust security solutions for ZTNs. Through case
studies, we illustrate practical approaches to securing ZTNs against both
conventional and AI/ML-specific threats, including the development of
autonomous intrusion detection systems and strategies to combat Adversarial ML
(AML) attacks. The paper concludes with a discussion of the future research
directions for the development of ZTN security approaches.";;
