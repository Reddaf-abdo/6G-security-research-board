http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08091v1;Revolution of Wireless Signal Recognition for 6G: Recent Advances, Challenges and Future Directions;11/03/2024;Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is a crucial technique for intelligent communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and reliability. Additionally, WSR can be applied for military applications such as signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades, great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly focus on model-based methods, including likelihood-based (LB) and feature-based (FB) methods, which have taken the leading position for many years.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07116v1;Efficient Integration of Distributed Learning Services in Next-Generation Wireless Networks;10/03/2024;Distributed learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence enabler, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs that assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the system, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times. This work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the importance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB traffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the consumed time and energy by DL within the CR. Due to its intractability, a session-based optimization problem has been proposed assuming a large-scale coherence time. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such problems and simulation results confirm the importance of such efficient and accurate integration design.;not identified in the document; A time-dependent optimization approach enhances distributed learning efficiency in 6G networks.

When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address critical challenges in 6G networks.
